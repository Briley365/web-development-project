    <!--Information about Me. -->
<h3>Some Stuff About Me Personally: </h3>
<P>
    My name is Briley Harrell and I’m a student at KSU who’s majoring in Geospatial 
    sciences with a minor in IT. I was born in South Georgia and lived near a small town called Ray City. 
    My parents divorced when I was around 3 or 4 resulting in my mom and my stepfather 
    moving us up to Paulding County, GA. Where I’ve spent most of my life. My mom also went to 
    KSU to get a degree in teaching and has been a teacher for over 10 years now. She is 
    part of the reason why I chose KSU. 
</P>
<h3>Experiences: </h3>
<p>  
    One experience I've had is travveling. Unfortunately, I haven’t travelled much but in high school I went to Spain and 
    saw the city of Barcelona, Madrid, and a city on the southern coast of Spain. Another thing I've experienced is what 
    it's like to work at a movie theater. Which for me is a great first job to have as for me it was a welcoming and simple
    job thats easy to learn. Not only that but you can get a few free tickets between paychecks and might get employee discounts.
    Which help make watching movies more affordable. I also used to play soccer when I was a child and was often a defensive 
    player for the teams I was on. Such as a center back. Which are the players that are positioned infront of 
    the goalies area around the goal. I was also a boy scout when I was younger and spent time out in the woods camping and learning knots.
    Though I only remember 1 knot these days.
</p>
<h3>Life Goals:</h3>
<p>
    One of my main goals in life is to try and find a solid career related to geospatial
    sciences. An idea that I think would be great is to work with GPS maps and such for 
    certain companies. Especially Google Earth map related stuff. As that would be a big 
    accomplishment and career opportunity. Another goal of mine is to try and expand my 
    skills into blue collar work while I search for a job that involves geospatial 
    related projects. Most likely electrician work or maybe something that also is in 
    good demand. Overall, I just want to be able to support myself and a family of my 
    own one day.
</p>

<h3>Additional Stuff:</h3>
<p>
    I also have ADHD. I manage it for the most part though so it doesn't interfere 
    in my life as much as it used to.
